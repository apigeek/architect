==============================

For example:
	Given I enable redirects <-- Undefined Step

You've used a phrase that Dialect doesn't understand. The Gerkin pattern was not recognised.

Possible Causes:

1) The appropriate vocabulary is not loaded.
2) You mis-typed the phrase.
3) The BDD dialect is broken.
